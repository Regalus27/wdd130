                <p>You are a Guardian of the Last City. Blessed by the Traveler with paracausal powers and near-immortality, you protect the last bastion of humanity from the encroaching forces of Darkness.</p>
                <p>This past year the story of Destiny 2 focused on how the Darkness, led by the Witness, has spread its influence across countless other systems, forcing them to either flee or join its march of death across the universe. Factions previously thought of as nothing more than monsters reached out asking for refuge or offered alliances, forcing us to examine what we fight for. Is it enough to guard the Last City, or do we need to fight for all threatened by the Darkness?</p>
                <p>I played this game more than any other in 2022. After 6 years of constant updates, the aging codebase is starting to fray a bit at the edges, but I still love this game and the people I've been able to meet playing it.</p>
