                Hello, my name is Cooper Anderson. There isn't much I want to share about myself, but I hope you're having a great day. I'm 22 years old, based in Colorado, and am taking classes through BYUI while dealing with daily headaches and migraines. I haven't enjoyed web design classes in the past, but hopefully this class will change that.
